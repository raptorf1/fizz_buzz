## Rspec demo and fizz_buzz exercise

We want a normal number to return that number,
a number divisible by three to return 'fizz',
a number divisible by five to return 'buzz' and
a number divisible by fifteen to return 'fizz buzz'.


Attention to the depreciated class "Fixnum". To newer versions of ruby "Integer" does the same.
